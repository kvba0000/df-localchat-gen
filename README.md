# ðŸ”® DF Local Chat Generator!
This is my hobby project done in free time. Basically you can create any [DONTFORGET](https://gamejolt.com/games/dontforget/150752) message however you like!

Actually... for that small site it has quite a lot of stuff!
- `âœ… Fully client-side generating!`
- `âœ… Animated messages!`
- `âœ… Customizing message!`
- `âœ… It even has Music player! (if you get bored)`
- `âœ… ...what's the best is IT'S COMPLETELY FREE!`
<sub>there are also some small secrets but they're not important :3</sub>

That's very easy! If you have an idea and you want it to be true you can just clone this repo with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kvba0000/df-localchat-gen
```
...and you should see new folder with the site files! All of them are in `src` folder.  
**NOTE:** For VS Code additional auto-complete you'll need [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) and install dependencies with `npm install` to get types of libraries I used.  
  
...speaking of libraries...
